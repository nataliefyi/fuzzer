# fuzzer
// Basic JS implementation of a fuzzer that uses all 16-bit unicode characters, aka the Base Multilingual Plane (BMP). It is based on https://www.fuzzingbook.org/html/Fuzzer.html

Eventually I want to add scripts to find all inputs/textareas in a webpage and fill them with random characters then submit the characters. If I get really ambitious I'll have it use something from https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists/tree/master/Fuzzing instead of random unicode characters
